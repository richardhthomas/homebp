The most common side effect that you may get is a dry cough. Many people are able to tolerate this side effect, as the alternative medications can be less effective. If you are started on these medications you need to have blood tests to monitor your kidney function. Although these drugs usually protect the kidneys in people with high blood pressure, on rare occasions they can make them worse. Sometimes when you first start taking them, these medications can make you feel dizzy, but this usually gets better after youâ€™ve been taking them for a couple of days."

Although they have less side effects, there is not as much evidence as to their effectiveness as there is for ACE inhibitors. Like their close relations ACE inhibitors, sometimes when you first start taking them, these medications can make you feel dizzy, but this usually gets better after youâ€™ve been taking them for a couple of days."
