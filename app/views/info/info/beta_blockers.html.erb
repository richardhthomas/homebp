			<h3>Benefits</h3>
			<p>These days beta-blockers are generally only added to other medications if your blood pressure hasnâ€™t already come down. Just like diuretics, we know they work but in most people they are less effective than calcium channel blockers or ACE inhibitors.</p>
			
			<h3>Side effects</h3>
			<p>The most common side effect is feeling tired. This is worse at higher doses so can sometimes be relieved by reducing the dose.</p>
