			<h2>Why do I need to take more than one medication?</h2>
			<p>Often you will find that a single medication is not enough to bring your blood pressure down on itâ€™s own. This means that you will need to take more than one medication. In many cases you will also get a bonus effect in that the combination of medications will reduce your blood pressure more than just the cumulative effect of each individual medication. This is called synergy.</p>
			<br />
			<h3>Why do I need to take a high dose of one medication and a low dose of another?</h3>
			<p>With some medications a low dose is enough to get all the benefits. With others, the higher the dose that you take, the greater the benefits.</p>
