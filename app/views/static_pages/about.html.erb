		<p>HomeBloodPressure.co.uk is run by Dr. Colin Coulthard and Dr. Richard Thomas, two UK trained General Practitioners (GPs). We have many years experience of treating high blood pressure and are certain that there is a better way to organise it.</p>
		<p>When working as GPs, our patients take time out of their busy days to come and see us for a simple blood pressure check, when they often have a perfectly good blood pressure monitor sat at home. All we then do is follow a set of rules to determine the best treatment for them and schedule any necessary further tests.</p>
		<p class='indent'>So, why do people have to come down to our consulting rooms for this?</p>
		<p class='indent'>Why can't most of this be automated to allow patients to get advice and prescriptions for their high blood pressure wherever and whenever they want?</p>
		<p>And so HomeBloodPressure.co.uk was born. Coupled with your home blood pressure monitor, we will provide all the advice and prescriptions you need to control your blood pressure.</p>
