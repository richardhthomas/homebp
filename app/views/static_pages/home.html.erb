	<p>This page should act as a hub to the rest of the site, aimed at those who aren't yet signed-up. So I think we should have details about the service, links to useful information (on our site), a link to the BP wizard etc</p><br />
	<p>Currently you will land here after logging in, but this will not be the case in future - I need to develop the logic to determine where you need to be sent after logging in (i.e. is a BP reading due or not)</p>
