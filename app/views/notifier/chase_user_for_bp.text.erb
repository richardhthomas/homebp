Hello from HomeBloodPressure.co.uk,

Is your blood pressure too high?

Please go to HomeBloodPressure.co.uk now to take another pair of blood pressure readings.

Taking several readings will give you an accurate measurement of what your blood pressure is really like.

Ideally try to take a pair of blood pressure readings every morning and evening for 4 days. Don't worry if you miss the occasional reading, but the set must span no more than a week, otherwise you will need to restart. This ensures that you get an accurate and up to date measure of your blood pressure so you will know if it is too high.

Remember, by using HomeBloodPressure.co.uk, you can measure your own blood pressure at home. You have a safe place to store the readings. You can see when your next reading is due. You will know whether your blood pressure needs treating. And you can do everything at a time and place that suits you…

If you decide that your blood pressure needs to be treated then you can take advantage of our easy to use prescription delivery service. This will help you to choose the right medication for you. Once you have chosen your medication, you’ll be able to get a prescription delivered to your door.
